Task 1: Java Fundamentals

   1- Implement a Java method called findMissingNumbers that takes an array of integers as input.
    The array contains numbers from 1 to N, but one or more numbers are missing. 
    The method should return an array containing all the missing numbers in ascending order. 
    For example, if the input array is [3, 1, 4], the method should return [2].

   2- Write a Java method called printPattern that takes an integer n as input and prints the following pattern:

	     *
   	    **
  	   ***
          ****
         *****
     The number of rows in the pattern should be equal to the value of n.

Task 2: Object-Oriented Programming

    Design and implement a class hierarchy for a simple banking system. 
    The hierarchy should include classes such as Bank, Account, Customer, and Transaction. 
    Provide appropriate attributes and methods for each class, 
    considering concepts like inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

    Implement a Java class called Employee with the following attributes: name, age, salary, and department. 
    Write a method called getAverageSalaryByDepartment that takes an array of Employee objects and returns a map where the keys are the 
    department names and the values are the average salaries of employees in each department.

Task 3: Problem-Solving

    Write a Java method called findLongestSubstring that takes a string as input and returns the length of the longest 
    substring without repeating characters. For example, if the input string is "abcabcbb", 
    the method should return 3 because the longest substring without repeating characters is "abc".

    Implement a Java method called isAnagram that takes two strings as input and returns true if they are anagrams 
    (contain the same characters but in a different order), and false otherwise. Ignore spaces and letter casing.
    For example, if the input strings are "listen" and "silent", the method should return true.
